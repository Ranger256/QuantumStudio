Preprocessor directives start with #.

Available preprocessor directives:
#include 'file.qasm' - Inserts the content of file.qasm (relative path) at the location of the directive.

#define CONSTANT SOURCE - Defines a constant CONSTANT with the value SOURCE. SOURCE can be empty.
Example:

qasm
#define TEST_CONSTANT 5  
print TEST_CONSTANT  ; Preprocessor replaces with: print 5  
#asign CONSTANT SOURCE - Redefines the constant CONSTANT to SOURCE.

#undef CONSTANT - Undefines the constant CONSTANT.

#ifdef CONSTANT - If CONSTANT is defined, the code between #ifdef and #else/#endif is included.
Example:

qasm
#define TEST_CONSTANT_0  
#ifdef TEST_CONSTANT_0  
print 6  
#else  
print 7  
#endif  
; Preprocessor outputs: print 6  
#ifndef CONSTANT - Opposite of #ifdef.
#else
#endif - Ends a conditional block.
